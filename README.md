# Mini-Waslni 🚗🗺️

Mini-Waslni is a C++ application with a Qt-based GUI that simulates a simple navigation system.  
It lets users create and connect cities on a virtual map, visualize the network, and find the shortest path between two cities using **BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.  
Users can also add or remove cities and roads, and save or load their maps from files.
